# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of two sorting algorithms along with their optimized versions, and a driver code showcasing tests for these functions.

## Algorithms Included:

1. **Bubble Sort**
   - Simple implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
   
2. **Optimized Bubble Sort**
   - An optimized version of the bubble sort algorithm to reduce unnecessary comparisons and swaps.
   
3. **Selection Sort**
   - Implementation of the selection sort algorithm for sorting doubly linked list.
   
4. **Optimized Selection Sort**
   - A more efficient version of the selection sort algorithm with minimized number of swaps.
